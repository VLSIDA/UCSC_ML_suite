# UCSC_ML_suite

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:VLSIDA/UCSC_ML_suite.git
```

2. Run the setup to clone ORFS as a submodule and link the settings:

```bash
cd UCSC_ML_suite
./setup.sh

```

3. [Run ORFS](https://vlsida.github.io/chip-tutorials/orfs-installation.html#run-orfs-docker-image) (this will run the Docker image corresponding to our submodule):

```bash
./runorfs.sh
```

4. Run a design in the Docker image:

```bash
make DESIGN_CONFIG=./designs/nangate45/lfsr_top/config.mk
```
## `dev` feature

By default, the suite will run using verilog that has already been generated from its respective source (just like in ORFS). If the user wishes to amend changes to source files, the command `make dev` should be used.
- `make dev` will perform the generation of verilog from the source repo (it`ll also do any prerequisite installation as well). 
- The development folder for each design can be found under `src/<DESIGN_NAME>/dev`

## Goal/Objectives

GOAL: Port open source designs to asap7/sky130/nangate45 technologies using ORFS, as a benchmark suite for ML projects.

Objective 1: Setup github CI/CD (to work with google cloud compute engine)

Objective 2: Formulate testbenches to verify the functionality of designs post-flow completion.

Objective 3: Expand suite by creating various versions of designs that fail at specific parts of the flow.
